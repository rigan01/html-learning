    <p>Hello and welcome to my motivation page. As Confucius once said:</p>
    <blockquote cite="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/c/confucius.html">
      <p>It does not matter how slowly you go as long as you do not stop.</p>
    </blockquote>
    <q cite="http://www.affirmationsforpositivethinking.com/index.htm">
      <p>I also love the concept of positive thinking, and The Need To Eliminate Negative Self Talk
      (as mentioned in Affirmations for Positive Thinking.)</p>

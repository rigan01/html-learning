          - We can write the machine-readable time and dates format:
          - We have a lot of options to set the value of the attribute datetime.
          - The datetime attribute is important because of options to write the time,
              you can write time in anyway, but if you want to make readable your time
                for computer reading machines, you should set the time element and give them
                  the datetime attribute with a value that represent the time.

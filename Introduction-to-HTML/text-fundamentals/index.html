    <h1>Ocean</h1>
    <!--
        - We can use h1, h2, h3, h4, h5, h6 tags for headings.
        - It is recomended to use h1 once per page for title, and then h2, and h3, and so on.
        - It is most important to use h1 instead of styling titles or some relevant data,
            because of search engines and screen readers, they will read h1 as an important information.

    <p>An ocean (from Ancient Greek Ὠκεανός, transc. Okeanós, the sea of classical antiquity) is a body of saline water that composes much of a planet's hydrosphere.</p>
    <!-- - Each paragraph has to be wrapped in a (p element) -->
    <p>On Earth, an ocean is one of the major conventional divisions of the World Ocean. These are, in descending order by area, the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, Southern</p>
    <p>(Antarctic), and Arctic Oceans.The word sea is often used interchangeably with "ocean" in American English but, strictly speaking, a sea is a body of saline</p>
    <p>water (generally a division of the world ocean) partly or fully enclosed by land.</p>

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <!--
        - We have to implement structural hierarchy for our headings.
        - i.e. a book: title of the story (h1), title of the chapter(h2), sub-sections
            of each chapter(h3), and so on.
    -->
    <p>The word « ocean » comes from the figure in classical antiquity, Oceanus (/oʊˈsiːənəs/; Greek: Ὠκεανός Ōkeanós, pronounced [ɔːkeanós]), the elder of the Titans in classical</p>
    <p>Greek mythology, believed by the ancient Greeks and Romans to be the divine personification of the sea, an enormous river encircling the world.</p>
    <p>The concept of Ōkeanós has an Indo-European connection. Greek Ōkeanós has been compared to the Vedic epithet ā-śáyāna-, predicated of the dragon Vṛtra-, who captured the cows/rivers.</p>
    <p>Related to this notion, the Okeanos is represented with a dragon-tail on some early Greek vases.</p>

    <h2>Earth's global ocean</h2>
    <h3>Oceaninc division</h3>
    <p>Though generally described as several separate oceans, the global, interconnected body of salt water is sometimes referred to as the World Ocean or global ocean.</p>
    <p>The concept of a continuous body of water with relatively free interchange among its parts is of fundamental importance to oceanography.</p>

        Lists
        - We are using lists everywhere, and in html we have 3 types of lists:
          1.Unordered lists
          2.Ordered lists
          3.Nesting lists
      -->
      <!-- Unordered list (When order doesn't matter!)-->
      <ul>
        <li>Milk</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Bananas</li>
        <li>Chocolate</li>
        <li>Meat</li>
      </ul>
      <!-- Ordered list (When order matter!) -->
      <ol>
        <li>Wakeup.</li>
        <li>The breakfast.</li>
        <li>The lunch.</li>
        <li>The dinner.</li>
        <li>Go to bed again.</li>
      </ol>
      <!-- Nested list (For some reasons, we can use nested lists! ) -->
      <ul>
        <li>Play Game</li>
        <li>Move forward</li>
        <li>Move left</li>
        <li>Attack</li>
        <li>You are dead</li>
        <li>Game Over</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Play Again</li>
          <li>Quit</li>
        </ul>
      </ul>

      <!-- Emphasis and importance -->

      <!--
          - If you want to just mark text as a italic one:
          - i element is used for foreign words, taxonomic destination, technical terms,
              a thought, etc.
        -->
      <p>I know <i>this is not</i> my cup of tea.</p>

      <!--
          - But when we want to mark up some instances, we can use (em - emphasis element),
            this is important, because after that, screen readers will read this chunk of Text
              with different tone of voice.
-->
      <p>I am <em>not</em> glad to see you.</p>
      <!--
          - Screen reader will read ,,not'' with different tone of voice.
      -->

      <!--
          - For strong importance we use (strong element - to mark up some instances),
            and (b element - to just make text bold)
          - b element is used for key words, product names, lead sentences, etc.
      -->
      <p>Smoking is <b>very</b> negative habbit.</p>

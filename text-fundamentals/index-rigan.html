    <h1>Heterodontosaurus</h1>
      <p><strong>Heterodontosaurus</strong> is a genus of heterodontosaurid dinosaur that lived during the Early Jurassic,
        200–190 million years ago. Its only known member species, Heterodontosaurus tucki, was named in
        1962 based on a skull discovered in South Africa. The genus name means <em>"different toothed lizard"</em>,
        in reference to its unusual, heterodont dentition; the specific name honors G. C. Tuck, who
        supported the discoverers. Further specimens have since been found, including an almost complete
        skeleton in 1966.
        Though it was a small dinosaur, Heterodontosaurus was one of the largest members of its family,
        reaching between 1.18 m (3.9 ft) and possibly 1.75 m (5.7 ft) in length, and weighing between 2
        and 10 kg (4.4 and 22.0 lb). The body was short with a long tail. The five-fingered forelimbs
        were long and relatively robust, whereas the hind-limbs were long, slender, and had four toes.
        The skull was elongated, narrow, and triangular when viewed from the side. The front of the jaws
        were covered in a horny beak. <b>It had three types of teeth</b>; in the upper jaw, small, incisor-like
        teeth were followed by long, canine-like tusks. A gap divided the tusks from the chisel-like
        <i>"cheek teeth"</i>.
        Heterodontosaurus is the eponymous and best-known member of the family Heterodontosauridae. This
        family is considered one of the most primitive or basal groups within the order of ornithischian
        dinosaurs. In spite of the large tusks, Heterodontosaurus is thought to have been herbivorous,
        or at east omnivorous. Though it was formerly thought to have been capable of quadrupedal
        locomotion, it is now thought to have been bipedal. Tooth replacement was sporadic and not
        continuous, unlike its relatives.
        At least four other heterodontosaurid genera are known from the same geological
        formations as Heterodontosaurus.</p>
      <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>Heterodontosaurus was a small dinosaur. The most complete skeleton, SAM-PK-K1332, belonged to
        an animal measuring about 1.18 m (3.9 ft) in length. Its weight was variously estimated at 1.8 kg
        (4.0 lb), 2.59 kg (5.7 lb), and 3.4 kg (7.5 lb) in separate studies.The closure of
        vertebral sutures on the skeleton indicates that the specimen was an adult, and probably fully
        grown. A second specimen, consisting of an incomplete skull, indicates that Heterodontosaurus
        could have grown substantially larger – up to a length of 1.75 m (5.7 ft) and with a body mass
        of nearly 10 kg (22 lb). The reason for the size difference between the two specimens is unclear,
        and might reflect variability within a single species, sexual dimorphism, or the presence of two
        separate species.The size of this dinosaur has been compared to that of a turkey.
        Heterodontosaurus was amongst the largest known members of the family Heterodontosauridae.
        The family contains some of the smallest known ornithischian dinosaurs – the <u>North American
        Fruitadens</u>, for example, reached a length of only 65 to 75 cm (26 to 30 in).</p>
      <h3>Skull and dentition</h3>
      <p>The skull of Heterodontosaurus was small but robustly built. The two most complete skulls measured
        108 mm (4 in) (holotype specimen SAM-PK-K337) and 121 mm (5 in) (specimen SAM-PK-K1332) in length.
        The skull was elongated, narrow, and triangular when viewed from the side, with the highest point
        being the sagittal crest, from where the skull sloped down towards the snout tip. The back of the
        skull ended in a hook-like shape, which was offset to the quadrate bone. The orbit (eye opening)
        was large and circular, and a large spur-like bone, the palpebral, protruded backwards into the
        upper part of the opening. Below the eye socket, the jugal bone gave rise to a sideways
        projecting boss, or horn-like structure. The jugal bone also formed a "blade" that created a
        slot together with a flange on the pterygoid bone, for guiding the motion of the lower jaw.
        Ventrally, the antorbital fossa was bounded by a prominent bony ridge, to which the animal's
        fleshy cheek would have been attached. The proportionally large lower temporal fenestra was
        egg-shaped and tilted back, and located behind the eye opening. The elliptical upper temporal
        fenestra was visible only looking at the top of the skull. The left and right upper temporal
        fenestrae were separated by the sagittal crest, which would have provided lateral attachment
        surfaces for the jaw musculature in the living animal.</p>
